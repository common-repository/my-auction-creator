= How can I modify the appearance of  My Auction Creator? =

While choosing from different themes, when you generate your My Auction Creator code you can also change the appearance using simple CSS rules. My Auction Creator will automatically use the default CSS rules for your web page, for example the default font and link colours so it integrates nicely with your page.

You can change the CSS rules for My Auction Creator by adding them to the My Auction Creator CSS Rules section of the plugin options page. See the My Auction Creator <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myauctioncreator.com/customize">Customize page</a> for more information and examples.

As a quick example, to make all of the items titles bold you would add this rule to your style sheet :

`div#auction-creator-items .title {
	font-weight: bold;
}`
				
And if you want to change the width of the 'Images Only' theme then add this rule to your style sheet:

`div#auction-creator-items {
	width: 400px;
}`
			
All themes can be adjusted in this way.
